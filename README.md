## Deploying

We use [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version) to release a new version.
This will create a git tag that is used by [poetry-dynamic-version](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning) to generate version strings.

However, we are using [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) which means we need to manually specify new versions.
For example, to bump the version to November 8, 2024, you would run the following command after activating the relevant conda environment.

```bash
bump-my-version bump --new-version 2024.11.8
```

After releasing a new version, you need to push and include all tags.

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```
